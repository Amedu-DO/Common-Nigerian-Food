        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Moi Moi, also known as Moin Moin, is a popular Nigerian dish made from steamed bean pudding. It's a staple in Nigerian cuisine and is often enjoyed as a main dish or a side dish. The primary ingredient is peeled black-eyed peas or brown beans, which are blended into a smooth paste and mixed with a variety of seasonings and ingredients such as onions, bell peppers, and oil.</p>
    
        <p>Additional optional ingredients can include fish, boiled eggs, crayfish, or corned beef for added flavor and protein. Moi Moi is usually wrapped in banana leaves, aluminum foil, or special Moi Moi containers and then steamed until it solidifies into a pudding-like texture.</p>
