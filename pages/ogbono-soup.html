        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ogbono Soup is a popular Nigerian soup made from ground Ogbono seeds (wild mango seeds). It is a favorite in many Nigerian households and is known for its rich, savory flavor and slightly slimy texture. The soup is typically prepared with a variety of meats such as beef, goat meat, and assorted offals, as well as fish and seafood like stockfish and dried fish.</p>
    
        <p>Ogbono Soup is often cooked with leafy vegetables like spinach, bitterleaf, or ugu (fluted pumpkin leaves) and is flavored with ingredients such as crayfish, palm oil, and seasonings. It is commonly served with fufu, pounded yam, or other Nigerian swallows (starchy side dishes).</p>
