    <ol>
        <li>Pick and rinse the beans thoroughly to remove any dirt or stones.</li>

        <li>Drain the beans and add fresh water. Continue cooking until the beans are tender.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan, heat palm oil over medium heat and sauté the chopped onions (and garlic if using) until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the sautéed onions, palm oil, crayfish (if using), and seasonings to the pot of beans. Stir well to combine.</li>
        <li>If using fish or meat, add them to the pot and continue to cook on low heat until the flavors meld and the beans reach a creamy consistency.</li>
        <li>If using vegetables, add them during the last few minutes of cooking to ensure they are tender but still vibrant.</li>
        <li>Adjust the seasoning with salt to taste. Serve hot, optionally with fried plantains, yams, or bread.</li>
