        <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Egusi soup is a popular Nigerian dish known for its rich, nutty flavor and creamy texture. It's made primarily from ground egusi seeds (melon seeds), which give the soup its name and unique taste. The soup typically includes a variety of meats such as beef, chicken, or fish, and often incorporates vegetables like spinach, bitter leaf, or pumpkin leaves</p>
    
       <p> To prepare Egusi soup, the ground egusi seeds are combined with broth or water to form a thick paste, which serves as the base. This paste is then simmered with assorted meats and/or fish, along with spices, palm oil, and sometimes stockfish or crayfish for added depth of flavor. The vegetables are usually added towards the end of cooking to preserve their freshness and vibrant color.</p>
        
        <p>Egusi soup is enjoyed across Nigeria and West Africa, and its ingredients can vary regionally or based on personal preference. It's often served with a side of pounded yam, fufu (a starchy side dish), or rice, making it a hearty and satisfying meal.</p>
