        <h3>Preparation Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and cut the yam into chunks. Rinse and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, heat the palm oil over medium heat and saut√© the chopped onions until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and bell peppers, and cook until the mixture is well combined and slightly reduced.</li>
            <li>Add the yam chunks to the pot, along with water or meat stock to cover the yam.</li>
            <li>Add the crayfish (if using) and seasonings (salt, bouillon cubes). Stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer until the yam is soft and the liquid has thickened, about 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>If using fish or meat, add them during the cooking process to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>If using leafy vegetables, add them during the last few minutes of cooking to ensure they are tender but still vibrant.</li>
            <li>Once the yam is soft, use a wooden spoon to mash some of the yam chunks to achieve a creamy consistency. Adjust the seasoning with salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve hot, either on its own or with a side of protein.</li>
        </ol>
