        <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jollof rice is a beloved West African dish with many regional variations. It's made with a unique blend of spices, long-grain rice, and a tomato and red pepper base. It is often served as a hearty entrÃ©e by adding beef, chicken, goat, or fish, or as is as a side.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>4 cloves Garlic</li>
        <li>4 Red Peppers</li>
        <li>2 Scotch Bonnet/Habanero Peppers</li>
        <li>2 Medium</li>
        <li>Red Onion</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon crushed Ginger</li>
        <li>1/2 cups Long grain White Rice</li>
        <li>Tablespoons Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>Chicken Stock Cube</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li> 2 Tablespoons Thyme</li>
        <li>2 Teaspoons smoked Paprika</li>
        <li> 1 Teaspoon Curry powder</li>
        <li>2 cups frozen vegetables (carrots, green beans, corn), optional</li>
        <li> 2 cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Here are some of the ingredients youâ€™ll need : Tomatoes, Red peppers, Scotch bonnet/Habanero peppers and Onions. </li>
   
    <li>Chop up the Tomatoes and Onions to size
         The Scotch Bonnet/Habanero peppers are Hot! And you can leave them as-is. They are small enough in size. And besides, you donâ€™t want that heat on your hands. ðŸ˜Š
        Use only 1 if the diners are not used to hot/spicy food.</li>

    <li>Transfer the above veggies (tomatoes, red pepper, Scotch Bonnets) to a blender and blend for about a minute, until smooth and liquefied. Set aside. ðŸ˜Š</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a deep pan, heat the oil and sautÃ© the onions together with the Garlic and Ginger until tender. 
        Then add the tomato paste, and fry for 2-3 minutes, just to get the raw taste out.</li>

    <li>To the cooking tomato paste mixture, add the blended tomato and cook for about 20 minutes on medium heat. Make sure you stir occasionally. You want this to reach a stage where the oil and paste begins to separate â€“ then you know youâ€™re good. ðŸ˜Š</li>
    
    <li>To the cooked Tomato mixture, add your washed rice (I used Nakonde rice) and mix in the frozen vegetables if using.
        I recommend you use them. 
        Also add 2 cups of water. Mix well.</li>

    <li>Transfer the entire rice mixture to an ovenproof dish, and cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake in the oven for about 1 hour at 180 degree Celsius. ðŸ˜Š</li>
    
    <li>Remove from the oven once ready and fluff the rice with a forkâ€¦. </li>

    <li>Transfer to your serving dish and garnish with some fresh chives, and serve. </li>
